A Proc is quite similar to a block but less 'fuzzy'.
The main difference between a proc and a block is that a proc is reusable since can be used as an instance of the Class Proc (i.e. like an object).



Why to use procs? In ruby a method can take only one block BUT can accept multiple procs.
TO CALL a proc in the method:

		procname.call(see .rb file for an example).
